hi,

 there is two different rar files in the dir , one is node js api that connect with mongodb data base for performing user oeration
 and other is react project , 
1. so extract both in seprate folder then
2. execute command npm install and install all the modules on local maschine
3. go to api folder and start server using node app.js file command
4. then go to react project folder and simply start react server using npm start

5. for login 
	redirect to /login
for register 
	redirect to  /register

	redirect to /movie
